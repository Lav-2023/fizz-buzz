# Fizz Buzz

This program solving is part of the 'Problem Solving' lesson from 'The Odin Project'.

    Write a program that takes a userâ€™s input and prints the numbers from one to the number the user entered. 
    However, for multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number and for the multiples of five print Buzz. 
    For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz.

Writing the pseudocode:

Here is an algorithm in pseudocode for this problem:

    1. When a user inputs a number
    2. Loop from 1 to the entered number
    3. If the current number is divisible by 3 then print "Fizz"
    4. If the current number is divisible by 5 then print "Buzz"
    5. If the current number is divisible by 3 and 5 then print "FizzBuzz"
    6. Otherwise print the current number
